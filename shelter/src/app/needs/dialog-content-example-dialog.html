  <h3>What is Angular?</h3>

  <p>
    Angular is a platform that makes it easy to build applications with the web.
    Angular combines declarative templates, dependency injection, end to end
    tooling, and integrated best practices to solve development challenges.
    Angular empowers developers to build applications that live on the web,
    mobile, or the desktop

  <h3>Architecture overview</h3>

  <p>
    Angular is a platform and framework for building client applications in HTML
    and TypeScript. Angular is itself written in TypeScript. It implements core
    and optional functionality as a set of TypeScript libraries that you import
    into your apps.
  </p>

  <p>
    The basic building blocks of an Angular application are NgModules, which
    provide a compilation context for components. NgModules collect related code
    into functional sets; an Angular app is defined by a set of NgModules. An
    app always has at least a root module that enables bootstrapping, and
    typically has many more feature modules.
  </p>

  <p>
    Components define views, which are sets of screen elements that Angular can
    choose among and modify according to your program logic and data. Every app
    has at least a root component.
  </p>

  <p>
    An app's components typically define many views, arranged hierarchically.
    Angular provides the Router service to help you define navigation paths
    among views. The router provides sophisticated in-browser navigational
    capabilities.
